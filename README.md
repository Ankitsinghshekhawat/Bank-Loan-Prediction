🏦 Bank Loan Amount Prediction – Linear Regression
📌 Project Description

This project implements a Machine Learning Linear Regression model to predict the loan amount approved by a bank based on customer financial and personal details.
The goal is to assist banks in making accurate and data-driven loan approval decisions.

This project is developed as part of an academic assignment on Machine Learning Regression.

🎯 Problem Statement

A bank wants to predict the Loan Amount (₹) that should be approved for customers using historical data such as income, credit score, employment details, and property value.
